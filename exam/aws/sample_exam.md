# AWS Certified Solution Architect Professional Exam Questions

## Question 1
A team is building an HTML form that is hosted in a public S3 bucket. The form uses JavaScript to post data to an API Gateway API endpoint. The API endpoint is integrated with Lambda functions. The team has tested each method in the API Gateway console and has received valid responses. Which combinations of steps must the team complete so that the form can successfully post to the API endpoint and receive a valid response?

### Answer
- Enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) on API Gateway.
- Configure S3 bucket for web hosting.

## Question 2
A company has many AWS accounts that individual business groups own. One of the accounts was recently compromised. The attacker launched a large number of instances, resulting in a high bill for that account. The company addressed the security breach, but the Solutions Architect needs to develop a solution to prevent excessive spending in all accounts. Each business group wants to retain full control of its AWS accounts. Which solution should the Solutions Architect recommend to meet these requirements?

### Answer
- Turn on billing alerts for each AWS account.
- Create CloudWatch alarms that send an SNS notification to the account administrator whenever the account exceeds the designated spending threshold.
